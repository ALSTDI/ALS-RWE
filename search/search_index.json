The OMOP tables in your data export are as follows:</p> Table Description Person Contains basic demographic information describing a participant, including biological sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity. Visit_occurrence Captures encounters with healthcare providers or similar events. Contains the type of visit a person has (outpatient care, inpatient care, or long-term care), as well as the date and duration information. Rows in other tables can reference this table, for example, condition_occurrences related to a specific visit. Condition_occurrence Indicates the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or symptom, which is either observed by a provider or reported by the patient. Drug_exposure Captures records about the utilization of a medication. Drug exposures include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as drugs. Drug exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensing, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information. Measurement Contains both orders and results of a systematic and standardized examination or testing of a participant or participant's sample, including laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. Procedure_occurrence Contains records of activities or processes ordered by or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. Observation Captures clinical facts about a person obtained in the context of an examination, questioning, or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by another domain, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, and family history, are recorded here. Device_exposure Captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Devices include implantable objects, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, other instruments used in medical procedures, and material used in clinical care. Death Contains the clinical events surrounding how and when a participant dies.
