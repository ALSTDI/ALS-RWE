# üì¶ Release Notes: Version 0.1.0

The first release of the [ALS TDI ARC Study](https://www.als.net/arc/), mapped to the [Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM)](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/), restructures a subset of the ARC Natural History Study into the OMOP CDM structure and maps a subset to standardized vocabularies.  

This is part of a larger harmonization effort with [Answer ALS](https://www.answerals.org/) and the [Critical Path Institute](https://c-path.org/program/critical-path-for-rare-neurodegenerative-diseases/).

> **Note about EHR data:** We are actively working to include electronic health record (EHR) data in future releases. Tools in use for EHR integration:  
> - [**CDAtransformer**](https://github.com/BoyceLab/CDAtransformer) ‚Äî Parse C-CDA and FHIR files into structured tables.  
> - [**RWDExchange**](https://github.com/BoyceLab/RWDExchange) ‚Äî Evaluate exchangeability of real-world data (EHR, registries) for external comparator trials.

---

## üóìÔ∏è Dates and Timing

- Dates may be shifted for de-identification ([Hripcsak et al., JAMIA 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocw001)).  
- If missing:  
  - Survey date, dummy `1900-01-01`, or approximate date applied.  
- Observation period:  
  - Start = first survey date  
  - End = last event or death date  

---

## ‚ùì Missing Data

- Not collected ‚Üí excluded unless required by OMOP CDM.  
- Not all participants have complete data.  
- Controls and asymptomatic carriers often have fewer entries.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Concepts

Some ALS-specific variables lacked standardized OMOP vocabularies; custom/local concepts (>2,000,000,000) were created.  

- **Anatomical site of symptom onset** ‚Üí `2000000396`  
- **El Escorial Criteria** ‚Üí `2000000061`  

### El Escorial Harmonization  
- Harmonized with Answer ALS & C-Path.  
- Self-reported, validated by ALS TDI staff.  

| El Escorial Status              | Custom Concept ID |
|---------------------------------|------------------:|
| Suspected                       | 2000000062        |
| Possible                        | 2000000058        |
| Probable Laboratory Supported   | 2000000060        |
| Probable                        | 2000000059        |
| Definite                        | 2000000057        |
