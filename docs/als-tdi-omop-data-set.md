# 📦 Release Notes: Version 0.1.0

The first release of the [ALS TDI ARC Study](https://www.als.net/arc/), mapped to the [Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM)](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/), restructures a subset of the ARC Natural History Study into the OMOP CDM structure and maps a subset to standardized vocabularies.  

This is part of a larger harmonization effort with [Answer ALS](https://www.answerals.org/) and the [Critical Path Institute](https://c-path.org/program/critical-path-for-rare-neurodegenerative-diseases/).

> **Note about EHR data:** We are actively working to include electronic health record (EHR) data in future releases. Tools in use for EHR integration:  
> - [**CDAtransformer**](https://github.com/BoyceLab/CDAtransformer) — Parse C-CDA and FHIR files into structured tables.  
> - [**RWDExchange**](https://github.com/BoyceLab/RWDExchange) — Evaluate exchangeability of real-world data (EHR, registries) for external comparator trials.

## 🧩 Domain Mappings

- **🧍 Person** ([Person Domain](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#PERSON))  
  - Year of birth, sex, race, ethnicity  
  - IDs sequentialized; prefixes `CASE_`, `CONTROL_`, `ASYMP_` retained  
  - Unknown/multiple race/ethnicity/sex → `concept_id = 0`  

- **📝 Observation** ([Observation Domain](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#OBSERVATION))  
  - ALSFRS-R (12 functional items + total score)  
  - Family & personal medical history  
  - History of head/neck injuries  
  - Symptom onset & anatomical site  
  - Lifestyle: tobacco use  
  - Occupation/industry, military service  
  - El Escorial Criteria (custom concept mapping)  

- **🧪 Measurement** ([Measurement Domain](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#MEASUREMENT))  
  - Laboratory results from blood draws:
    - A/G Ratio, Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase, Basophils (%/Abs), Bilirubin Total, BUN, Creatinine, Calcium, Chloride, CO2, EGFR, Eosinophils (%/Abs), Globulin, Glucose, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Lymphocytes (%/Abs), MCH, Monocytes (%/Abs), Neutrophils (%/Abs), Platelets, Potassium, RDW, RBC Count, SGOT, SGPT, Sodium, Total Protein, WBC Count  
  - Self-reported ALS-linked genetic mutations:
    - PFN1, SOD1, SPG11, FUS, TARDBP, C90RF72, VCP, NEK1  

- **💊 Drug Exposure** ([Drug Exposure Domain](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#DRUG_EXPOSURE))  
  - Self-reported medications & supplements  
  - Ingredient-level mapping (≥20 frequency mapped, others = 0)  
  - Dosage not calculated; source values retained  
  - Missing start date → dummy `1900-01-01`  
  - Missing end date → start date reused  

- **⚰️ Mortality** ([Death Domain](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html#DEATH))  
  - Date of death (month/day set to `12-31` for privacy)  

---

## 🗓️ Dates and Timing

- Dates may be shifted for de-identification ([Hripcsak et al., JAMIA 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocw001)).  
- If missing:  
  - Survey date, dummy `1900-01-01`, or approximate date applied.  
- Observation period:  
  - Start = first survey date  
  - End = last event or death date  

---

## ❓ Missing Data

- Not collected → excluded unless required by OMOP CDM.  
- Not all participants have complete data.  
- Controls and asymptomatic carriers often have fewer entries.  
---

## 🛠️ Custom Concepts

Some ALS-specific variables lacked standardized OMOP vocabularies; custom/local concepts (>2,000,000,000) were created.  

- **Anatomical site of symptom onset** → `2000000396`  
- **El Escorial Criteria** → `2000000061`  

### El Escorial Harmonization  
- Harmonized with Answer ALS & C-Path.  
- Self-reported, validated by ALS TDI staff.  

| El Escorial Status              | Custom Concept ID |
|---------------------------------|------------------:|
| Suspected                       | 2000000062        |
| Possible                        | 2000000058        |
| Probable Laboratory Supported   | 2000000060        |
| Probable                        | 2000000059        |
| Definite                        | 2000000057        |
