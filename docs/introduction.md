Real-World Evidence (RWE) plays a critical role in understanding disease progression, evaluating treatment outcomes, and supporting clinical decision-making. Unlike controlled clinical trials, RWE leverages real world data (RWD) from diverse real-world settings including natural history studies and electronic health records.

At the ALS Therapy Development Institute (ALS TDI), we have been at the forefront of RWE through our long-running ALS Research Collaborative (ARC) study. Weâ€™ve added the expertise of **Dr. Danielle Boyce**, a nationally recognized RWE expert with decades of experience in patient registries, digital health technologies, and Electronic Health Records Data.  She is also a leader in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community. We are also partnered with **Pat Dolan**, and his organization, *GeoALS*, leaders in geospatial analysis, to add maps to our ALS RWE toolkit.  Our other collaborators include Answer ALS and the Critical Path Institute, with whom we are harmonizing our data. 

This book provides foundational resources, practical guidance, and comprehensive documentation for researchers, clinicians, and data scientists interested in RWE methodologies, with a special focus on ALS research using the Obervational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). Our goal is to make the learning curve less steep so that we can all worth together to accelerate discoveries in ALS/MND and beyond.
