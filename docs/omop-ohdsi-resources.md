## üíª OMOP Code Snippets

We provide a publicly available set of OMOP code snippets used in the [I-LEARN Course](https://ilearn.tuftsctsi.org/product?catalog=D1RS_2025_18) to help learners explore and analyze OMOP Common Data Model datasets using tools like **R**, **SQL**, and **Python**.

üîó **Repository**: [BoyceLab/OMOP-Code-Snippets-for-I-LEARN-Course](https://github.com/BoyceLab/OMOP-Code-Snippets-for-I-LEARN-Course)

### üß∞ What You'll Find in this Repository
The repository contains example scripts and templates to:

- Query OMOP data using **SQL**
- Analyze OMOP-mapped data using **R**
- Connect and run queries via **RPostgreSQL**
- Explore how standard concepts relate to source codes

### üìÇ Folder Highlights

- SQL/: Ready-to-use SQL queries for common OMOP domains (e.g., drug exposure, observation).
- R/: R scripts that demonstrate how to load, analyze, and visualize OMOP data.
- concepts/: Examples for working with concept_id and concept_relationship tables.

### üìò Use Cases

These snippets are designed for:
- Learners in the **Tufts CTSI I-LEARN course**
- Researchers new to **OHDSI/OMOP**
- Analysts working with **OMOP-formatted ALS datasets**
