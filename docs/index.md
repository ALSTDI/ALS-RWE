Welcome to the **ALS-RWE Knowledge Hub**.  
This site brings together resources, methods, and publications to support the use of real-world evidence (RWE) in ALS research. Our goal is to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration by providing a centralized space for:  

- Understanding how ALS data sets can be transformed into the **OMOP Common Data Model**.  
- Learning about methods such as the **STARDUSTT approach** for structuring analyses.  
- Accessing tools and resources developed by the **OHDSI** community.  
- Exploring selected publications and ongoing projects led by our collaborators.  

This project is an initiative of the **[ALS Therapy Development Institute](als.net).**  We invite clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to use these materials as a foundation for further studies and to join the effort of advancing data-driven ALS research.
